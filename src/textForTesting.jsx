Welcome to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## How to use this?

1. Write markdown in the markdown editor window
2. See the rendered markdown in the preview window

### Features

- Create headings paragraph links blockquotes, inline codes, code blocks and lists.
- Name and save the document to access again later.
- Choose between light and dark mode depending on your preferences

> This is an example of blockquotes. If you would like to learn more about markdown syntax, you can visit [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

#### Headings

To create heading, add the hash sign before the heading. The number of signs should correspond to the heading level(not necessarily in the correct way you should use headings!) to illustrate how they should look.

##### List

You can see example of ordered and unordered list above.


###### Code Blocks

This mark down editor allows for codes snippets like the one below:

```
<main>
 <div>
  <h1>This is a blockquote</h1>
 </div>
</main>
```

Thank you for using the app...
      
      
      
      
      
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default textForTesting
